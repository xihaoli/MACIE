# MACIE (Multi-dimensional Annotation Class Integrative Estimation)

## Description
Thank you for your interest in MACIE. MACIE (Multi-dimensional Annotation Class Integrative Estimation) is an unsupervised multivariate mixed model framework capable of integrating annotations of diverse origin to assess multi-dimensional functional roles for both coding and noncoding variants in the human genome.

## Data Availability and Reproducibility
The MACIE scores (and other integrative scores) used in all benchmarking examples are available for download [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gzqsfgaO1WCh5pAQUgVlUNsX9HYneO7p?usp=sharing). Precomputed MACIE scores for all nonsynonymous coding, synonymous coding and noncoding variants in the human genome is under construction.

All genomic coordinates are given in NCBI Build 37/UCSC hg19.
